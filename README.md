# MLR Bike Sharing Assignment

## Problem Statement:

BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has experienced a significant drop in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To recover, they aim to understand the factors influencing bike demand to better prepare for post-pandemic market conditions. The company wants to know:

   - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
   - How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Business Goal:

The business goal is to model the demand for shared bikes using available independent variables. This model will help BoomBikes understand how demand varies with different features, enabling them to adjust their business strategy to meet customer needs. By predicting bike demand, BoomBikes aims to stand out from competitors and maximize profits as the market recovers post-pandemic. The insights gained will also help the company understand demand dynamics in new markets.
